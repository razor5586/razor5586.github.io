#Goal of this tutorial
In this tutorial you will learn some basics techniques for working with PADrend.
In the first part we will load the first scene.

The second part is about navigation.
You will learn to move through a scene in three different ways, namely by keyboard, by mouse and by gamepad.

#Assumption
